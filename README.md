# Introduction

Natural Bridge is located in Slade, Ky and is about an hour east of Lexington, KY. It is a naturally forming arch that is made out of sandstone. It's a tourist hot spot for many kentuckians. I have been to the hiking trails at Natural Bridge a few times and I always enjoy the views!

# Goals of the project
my goal for this project was to learn more and see natural bridge in a new way. I have been there a few times but being able to map it in a few different ways was a good experience.
#
This project was created by Timothy Stuart for a final project in GEO 409 taken at the University of Kentucky during the spring of 2021.
#
While making this project I used Mapbox, Cesium ion, and ArcGISpro. Some data was from KyFromAbove project.
